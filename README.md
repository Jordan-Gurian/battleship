Battleship game built using TDD.

UI appearance mediocre and there are still minor bugs with the initial hover effect, but primary focus was practicing TDD and getting backend functional. If I revisit this project, tasks to work include:
-Improve UI appearance/aesthetic
-Stop ships from hovering over multiple lines before placement when out of bounds
-Show which ships have been sank and which have not for each player
-Enable two human players rather than 1 human and 1 computer
-Give computer smarter attack selection (rather than random numbers)
